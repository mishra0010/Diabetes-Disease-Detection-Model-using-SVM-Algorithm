## Diabetes Prediction Model using SVM ðŸ©º

Project Overview
The aim of this project is to build a Diabetes Prediction Model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, focusing on a dataset consisting entirely of female patients. This specialized model not only predicts the likelihood of diabetes but also offers an interactive feature for users to input their health metrics and check their risk.

Project Description
Diabetes is a major health concern worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective management. This project leverages machine learning to predict diabetes in female patients based on various health indicators. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was chosen for its robustness in binary classification tasks. The model can be used to predict whether a person is diabetic based on inputs such as blood pressure, glucose levels, BMI, and other relevant features.


Features

Interactive Prediction Tool: Users can input their health metrics to get an instant prediction of their diabetes risk.
Female-Focused Analysis: The dataset is composed entirely of female patients, allowing for a tailored analysis.
SVM Model: A robust classifier designed to handle the nuances of the dataset effectively.
Data
The dataset used in this project consists of health records of female patients, including features such as:

Glucose Level
Blood Pressure
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Age
DiabetesPedigreeFunction	
Insulin Levels
Pregnancies
Skin Thickness
Outcome

Model Training
The model was trained using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Key steps in the training process included:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and selecting relevant features.

Evaluation
The model was evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy of both test and train data
Theis metrics were chosen to ensure that the model performs well not just in general accuracy, but also in correctly identifying both diabetic and non-diabetic cases.

Usage
Users can input their health data through the interactive tool to receive a prediction on whether they are at risk of diabetes. The model's predictions are based on the specific health indicators of female patients.
